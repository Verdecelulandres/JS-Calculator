This is a basic calculator built with JavaScript
This is the 4th project to get the FCC FrontEnd Libraries certification
https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator


Since this is a demo project I will be limiting my calculator to only handle numbers of max 7 digits and math expressions of no more than 5 elements. Meaning the max number achieved will be with the expression: 9999999 * 9999999 * 9999999 * 9999999 * 9999999
